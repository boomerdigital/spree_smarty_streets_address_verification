# In theory everything below *should* be replaceable with just:
#
#   jQuery.LiveAddress key: smarty_key, enforceVerification: true, autoVerify: false
#
# But because of a bug in the SmartyStreets plugin we have a lot more code.
# The country field can be a drop-down but the plugin looks at the "id" not
# the visual label (the state dropdown is better as it looks at the label).
# This means when the US is selected the plugin thinks the country selected
# is "232". Since it doesn't know "232" is the United States it thinks it is
# a foreign country and therefore doesn't do auto-complete or address
# validation.
#
# To work around this we have removed the country from the list of fields that
# the plugin will scan for when mapping a form for address fields. Since there
# is no country (from the plugin's perspective) it *assumes* the US (since
# that is really the only thing it can auto-complete and validate anyway).
# This works around the problem.
#
# But now we have an additional problem. If the user wants to select a
# different country, it will still assume we are in the US and will tell the user
# that the address is invalid even though it may be a perfectly valid foreign
# address. To deal with this we disable the address validation if foreign.
#
# If the address started as foreign then switches to US ideally we would like
# to re-enable the validation but due to another bug in SmartyStreets it doesn't
# handle the state select list being dynamically updated. In that case we leave
# it disabled and rely on server-side validation.
